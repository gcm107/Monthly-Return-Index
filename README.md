# Monthly-Return-Index
Monthly total return index for investing $1m on different start dates over a 15 year period

## Analysis and Conclusions:
- Best Performing Start Date: 2008-01-01
- Worse Performing Start Date: 2000-01-01

- Starting during market downturns like in 2008 (housing market crash) can lead to better long term returns than starting at market peaks like in 2000 (.com bubble)

- Market downturns create opportunities but timing the market is very difficult, so time in market should be the focus over timing the market.
